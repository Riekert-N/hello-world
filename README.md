Just getting started!

I've just started delving into the world of webdev and this'll be a journal of progress along the way!

Well, immediately fell off the horse for about a week. I finished the first module about learning tables, then didn't touch it again. I've been working from home for almost a month now and it has slowed a lot recently due to me getting taken off the main line. I'm hopeful that in the next day or two I'll be able to put an increased effort into this. As a refresher, i'm going to try building a quick table on my website. --- ok, made a table. fuck that was stupid. a lot of code for a simple timestable.
